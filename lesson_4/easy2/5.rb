# There are a number of variables listed below. What are the different types
# and how do you know which is which?

excited_dog = "excited dog" # Local variable
@excited_dog = "excited dog" # Instance variable
@@excited_dog = "excited dog" # Class variable

# In Ruby, variable names (excluding constants) are written in snake_case.
# Local variables aren't prepended with `@`. Instance variables are prepended
# with a single `@`. Class variables are prepended with two `@` signs.
