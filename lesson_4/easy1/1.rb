# Which of the following are objects in Ruby? If they are objects, how can you
# find out what class they belong to?

# true => instance of the True class
# "hello" => instance of the String class
# [1, 2, 3, "happy days"] => instance of the Array class
# 142 => instance of the Integer class

# All of the examples are objects. We can call the `#class` method on an
# instance, which returns the class it belongs to.
